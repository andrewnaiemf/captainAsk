            provider as the third party service provider's limited payment collection agent. Payment
            of fees in this manner shall be deemed effective as if the payment was made directly by
            you to the third party service provider. The Fees shall include applicable taxes as
            stipulated by law and all fees paid by you are final and non-refundable unless otherwise
            specified by the Captain Ask application. You reserve the right to request a reduction

            application using your preferred payment method specified in your account, after which
            the Captain Ask application will send you a receipt via email. If the primary payment
            method that you set in your account is expired, invalid, or cannot be paid through, then
            you agree that Captain Ask, as the limited payment collection agent for the third party
            service provider, may use the secondary payment method in your account, if any. As
            agreed between you and the Captain Ask application, the Captain Ask application
            reserves the right to establish, cancel or revise fees for any or all services or goods

            in certain geographic areas may be significantly increased during times of high demand
            and Captain Ask will use reasonable efforts to notify you of fees that may apply to you
            provided that you will be responsible for the fees incurred in your account regardless
            of your awareness of them or the respective amounts in this account. Captain Ask may
            from time to time provide users with promotional offers and discounts that may result
            in varying amounts being paid to obtain the same services or goods or to obtain similar
            services and goods during the use of the Services. You agree that such promotional
            offers and discounts will not be applicable unless they are also made available to you
            in connection with your use of the Services or fees charged to you. You may choose to
            cancel your order for services or goods from a third party service provider at any time
            prior to its arrival and you may be required to pay a cancellation fee. This payment
            structure is intended to fully compensate the third party service provider for the services
            and goods provided, with the exception of taxi transportation services requested
            through the application. Captain Ask does not allocate any portion of your payment as
            a tip or gratuity to the third party service provider. Any statement made by Captain Ask
